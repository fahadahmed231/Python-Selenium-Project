# Python-Selenium-Project
 This Python project automates the scraping of Amazon India's search results using Selenium. It browses multiple pages for a given query (e.g., "laptop") and saves the HTML of each product listing into separate files. Ideal for data collection and market research, with a focus on compliance and ethical use.
